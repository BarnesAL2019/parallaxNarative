      <h1>Kirby's Dream Land</h1>
      <p>This was the very first appearence of Kirby! Released in 1992, this endearing character went on to lead its very own series of games to come. I have never personally played this original game, however it is very significant in starting it all.</p>

      <h1>Kirby & the Amazing Mirror</h1>
      <p>This entry from 2002 definitely sticks out as a unique entry in the series. Unlike other Kirby games, Amazing Mirror plays as a Metroidvania maze where the map branches out in several directions meaning the player can go almos anywhere in almost any order. It also has multiplayer allowing for a divide and concer strategy to explore the game. </p>

      <h1>Kirby: Squeak Squad</h1>
      <p>This game is my favorite as I have fond memories of playing it as my first real introduction to Kirby. In this 2006 entry Kirby faces the Squeaks, an infamous group of treasure-thieving mice along with familiar faces such as King Dedede and Meta Knight. While not the most standout game in terms of mechanics, it has a lot of charm and I always found it to be super fun.</p>

        <h1>Kirby Super Star Ultra</h1>
        <p>This 2008 game is actually a re-make of Kirby Super Star for the Nintendo DS made for the series' 15th anniversary. I never played the original game, however I consider this version to be superior as it includes the original game modes along with four new ones. It also has enhanced graphics and audio, along with full-motion video cutscenes.</p>

        <h1>Kirby's Epic Yarn</h1>
        <p>The first Wii game on this list, Kirby's Epic Yarn was released in 2010. When transported to Patch Land, a world made completely out of fabric, Kirby must help Prince Fluff to collect seven pieces of magic yarn. This entry to the series is super creative and fun often using the environment in unexpected ways to solve puzzles or progress. It definitely has the most unique look of all the games! </p>

        <h1>Kirby's Return to Dream Land</h1>
        <p>This is the twelfth installment of the Kirby series released in 2011. Return to Dream Land is a return to form of traditional platforming as well as Kirby's copy ability. The best part of the game in my opinion is its multiplayer options as I fondly remember playing this game with my two siblings. Teamates can join in as other color Kirby, King Dedede, Waddle Dee, and even Meta Knight!</p>

        <h1>Kirby: Triple Deluxe</h1>
        <p>Retuning to the handheld system, Kirby: Triple Deluxe was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2014. This entry has gameplay similar to that of platroming DS games in the past as well as Return to Dreamland, although this time Kirby asends a Dreamstalk to help save Kind Dedede. This game also introduces Hypernova Kirby which allows Kirby to inhale extremely large objects after eating a rainbow-colored Miracle Fruit. </p>

        <h1>Kirby Star Allies</h1>
        <p>This game released in 2018 was the first Kirby game on the Nintendo Switch. This game allows Kirby to enlist the help of up to three companions by throwing hearts at enemies to create allies. This also allows Kirby to fuse different abilities together to make them stronger. This is not my favorite game due to it's easy difficulty, however it's still a very chaming game with a lot of fun aspects.</p>

        <h1>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h1>
        <p>This is the newest Kirby game released for the Nintendo Switch on March 25th 2022. This revolutionary title is the first game in the series to be fully 3D which brings a whole new span of possibility to the world. I have loved playing this game so far, and it is especially satisfying to be helping save Waddle Dees and bring their town back to life. Kirby also has a new "Mouthful Mode" similar to that of Hypernova mode from Triple Deluxe where Kirby can swallow and control large objects such as a Car or Vending Machine. </p>
