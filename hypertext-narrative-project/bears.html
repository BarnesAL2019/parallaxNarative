					Bears
				</h2>

				<p class="first-paragraph">
					While seeing exotic animals from different parts of the world, it's also nice to get a chance to view more local wildlife in a safe environment. While you might not want to find a bear while on a hike or rifling through your trash can, they are definitely quite the animal to observe. Their cuddly face is sort of similar to that of the <a href="red-pandas.html">red panda</a>, while their strength is much more in line with that of an <a href="elephants.html">elephant</a> or <a href="rhinos.html">rhino.</a> It's also very cool to see the different species of bear and how different they function.

					As you take a look at the different bears, you read a little bit of information about each of them. 

				</p>
				<p>
				Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They’re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
			</p>
<p>
They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell. They’re typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs. There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears.
</p>
<p>
On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable.
