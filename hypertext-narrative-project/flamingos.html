					Flamingos
				</h2>

				<p class="first-paragraph">
					Approaching the small lake near the train and carosel, you see a swarm of pink. Just what you were looking for! A flamboyance of flamingos! The way that the birds manage to balance on one leg has always astounded you, and their long, bendy necks remind you of the <a href="giraffes.html">giraffes.</a> You enjoy the peaceful atmosphere that the birds provide. Then suddenly you hear a rustling from below. Looking down you see a few chicks just waking up from their nap. It's strange to see the bird without its classic pink feathers, but they are still adorable regardless. Yet they still aren't the most <a href="red-pandas.html">adorable animal</a> to be seen at the zoo.

					Thinking this might be a nice time for a snack, you relax under the shade watching the birds and read some facts while you eat.

				<h3>
					Flamingo Trivia
				</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						There are only six species of flamingos in the world, though several of those species have subspecies divisions and could eventually be split into different unique species. All flamingos belong to the bird family Phoenicopteridae, and they are the only members of that scientific bird family.
					</li>
					<li>
						Flamingos are found around the world from the Caribbean and South America to Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. They are also popular guests in many zoos, aviaries, aquariums, marine parks, and botanical gardens well outside their native ranges. Occasional escaped flamingos often make headlines among birders or on local news networks.
					</li>
					<li>
						The word "flamingo" comes from the Spanish and Latin word "flamenco" which means fire, and refers to the bright color of the birds' feathers. Not all flamingos are brightly colored, however, and some of the birds are mostly gray or white. The strength of a flamingo's coloration comes from its diet. Younger birds also have less coloration.
					</li>
					<li>
						While flamingos are considered wading birds, the same classification as herons, egrets, spoonbills, and cranes, they are most closely related to grebes genetically.
					</li>
					<li>
						Flamingos are strong but rare swimmers and powerful fliers, even though they're most often seen just wading. Flamingos do fly very well, however, and many flamingos migrate or regularly fly between the best food sources and nesting grounds.
